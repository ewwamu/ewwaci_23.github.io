        SYNOPSIS
        <br>
        <br>
        Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick) has an uncanny skill at cutting
         classes and getting away with it. Intending to make one last duck-out 
         before graduation, Ferris calls in sick, "borrows" a Ferrari, and 
         embarks on a one-day journey through the streets of Chicago. On Ferris' 
         trail is high school principal Rooney (Jeffrey Jones), determined to 
         catch him in the act.

    23  INT. BOY'S BEDROOM                                           23
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        It's a dark, dreary sick room. Shades drawn, floor strewn
        with used tissues, nightstand a still-life of over the
        counter remedies. A high school boy, CAMERON: FRYE, is laying
        in bed. We don't see his face, only a silhouette with a
        thermometer sticking out his mouth. U2's SUNDAY BLOODY
        SUNDAY is playing. He's mumbling random words.
        <br>
        <br>

                              CAMERON:
                          (weak)
               Hello?
        <br>
        <br>
                              FERRIS' VOICE:
               CAMERON! What's happening?
        <br>
        <br>

                              CAMERON:
               Very little.
        <br>
        <br>
                              FERRIS' VOICE:
               How do you feel?
        <br>
        <br>
                              CAMERON:
               Shredded.
        <br>
        <br>
                              FERRIS' VOICE:
               Is your mother in the room?
               <br>
               <br>
     CAMERON takes the thermometer out of his mouth.
     <br>
     <br>
                              CAMERON:
               She's not home. Where are you?
               <br>
               <br>
                              FERRIS' VOICE:
               Home.
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
 24  INT. FERRIS' FAMILY ROOM. FERRIS                             24
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
     Ferris is sprawled out in the chair.
     <br>
     <br>
                              FERRIS:
               I'm taking the day off. Get
               dressed and come over.
               <br>
               <br>
                              CAMERON'S VOICE:
               I can't. I'm sick.
               <br>
               <br>
                              FERRIS:
               It's all in your head. Come on over.
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
 25  INT. CAMERON'S ROOM                                          25
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
     CAMERON's insistent.
     <br>
     <br>
                              CAMERON:
               I feel like complete shit, Ferris.
               I can't go anywhere.
               <br>
               <br>
                              FERRIS' VOICE:
               I'm sorry to hear that. Now, come
               on over and pick me up.
               <br>
               <br>
     Ferris disconnects. CAMERON slowly hangs up the phone.
     <br>
     <br>
                              CAMERON:
               I'm dying.
               <br>
               <br>
     The phone rings again. CAMERON hits the speaker button.
     <br>
     <br>
                              FERRIS' VOICE:
               You're not dying. You just can't think
               of anything good to do.
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
 26  INT. FERRIS' FAMILY ROOM                                     26
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
     Ferris hangs up.
     <br>
     <br>
                              FERRIS:
               If anybody needs a day off, it's
               cameron. He has alot of things to
               sort out before he graduates. He
               can't be wound this tight and go
               to college. His roommate'll kill
               him. I've come close myself. But I
               like him. He's a little easier to
               take when you know why he's like he
               is. The boy cannot relax. Pardon
               by French but cameron is so tight
               that if you stuck a lump of coal up
               his ass, in two weeks you'd have a
               diamond.
        <br>

        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
     He's on the telephone. As he speaks he does a little
     MacPainting on his MacIntosh. A Modigliani nude.
        <br>
        <br>
                              FERRIS:
               i'm serious, man. this is bullshit, 
               making me wait around the house for you.
        <br>

        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Cameron's back in bed.
        <br>
        <br>
                              CAMERON:
                do you know what my diastolic is?
