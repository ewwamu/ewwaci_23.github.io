        A discussion between the two protagonists, Celine and Jesse, on traditional and personal ideas of love:
    </div>
    <br>
    <br>
    C: No, no, no. Okay, speaking seriously here. I mean, I feel this pressure to be a strong and independent icon of womanhood and not have it look like my life is only revolving around some guy, but the love of a man and returning that love means a lot to me. I always make fun of it and stuff, but isn’t everything we’re doing in life a way to be loved a little more or something? 
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    J: Sometimes I dream of being a good father and a good husband. Sometimes that feels really close, but other times it just seems silly, and that it would ruin my life. It’s not that I have a fear of commitment or I’m incapable of loving or caring about someone else, because I can. It’s just that if I’m totally honest with myself, I’d rather die knowing that I was really good at something, that I was special or had excelled in some way, than to have only been in a really nice, caring relationship.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    C: You know, I had worked for this older man, and once he told me that he had spent all his life thinking about his career and his work, and how he was fifty-two and it suddenly struck him that he had never really given anything of himself, that his life was for no one and nothing. <br>He was almost crying saying this. (a beat) I really believe that if there’s any kind of god, he wouldn’t be in any one of us - not you, not me - but just this space in between. <br><br>If there’s some magic in this world, it must be in the attempt of understanding someone else, sharing something, even if it’s almost impossible to succeed. But who cares - the answer must be in the attempt.
